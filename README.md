# Hey there! 👋

I'm Miguel, a cybersecurity auditor based in Spain.

I hunt bugs for a living and break applications before the bad guys do.

My main focus is bug bounty, web security, mobile pentesting, and cloud infrastructure audits. My favorite tools are Burp Suite, Python scripts, and a good cup of coffee ☕

I've found over XX vulnerabilities across different programs, but privately... it's probably way more than that at this point.
